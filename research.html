      <h2>Research Experience</h2>
      <h3>Modelling the Restaurant Problem Using Quantum Strategies</h3>
      <p>
      Quantum game theory is an extension of classical game theory that models situations and interactions between players using quantum physics. It employs features of quantum theory such as entanglement and superposition of states, and, for this reason, is an opportunity to gain more understanding of these concepts through their effects in a modelled real-life situation. Furthermore, quantum game theory can have more advantageous probabilities of success in a modelled game than classical game theory, thanks to the use of quantum strategies in decision-making.
      </p>
      <p>
      In this project, the restaurant problem is modelled using quantum game theory. The aim of the project is to find a quantum strategy that increases the probability of winning the restaurant problem, compared to the optimal classical strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project is my fourth-year research project, and was
        supervised by Shohini Ghose at the University of Waterloo and Laurier University.

      <h3>Applying Deep Learning to Continuous-Time Quantum Monte Carlo Algorithms</h3>
      <p>
        Condensed matter physics and solid state matter physics problems often deal
        with materials with strongly-correlated particles. Solving these many-body
        systems consists of solving the partition function of the system,
        which describes the correlations between the particles of the systems.
        This is a very computationally complex task, as the number of particles in
        the system can be very large.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm have been used to calculate the partition function. The goal of this internship topic was to explore whether we can apply deep learning techniques to these Monte Carlo methods to further decrease the computational complexity of the Monte Carlo simulations.
      </p>

        This project was co-supervised by André-Marie Tremblay at the Université de Sherbrooke, Simon Verret at the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA), and Charles-David Hébert at the Université de Sherbrooke.

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <h3>Reconstructing Quantum States with Generative Models</h3>
      <p>
        This project was the final project for PHYS 490, a physics course on Machine Learning in Physics offered at the University of Waterloo (Winter 2020). 
        The aim of the project was to choose a physics paper that applied machine learning techniques to physics, become familiar with its methods and results, and
        recreate some of the results using machine learning models of our own making.
      </p>
      <p>
        The paper we chose was Reconstructing Quantum State with Generative Models by Carrasquilla et al (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.10584.pdf). Following the methods 
        in this paper, we constructed Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) that reconstructed quantum states from an input.
      </p>
      <h3>Generating Main Sequence Stars from Initial Conditions</h3>
      <p>
        This project was the final project for PHYS 375, a physics course on Stars offered at the University of Waterloo (Winter 2019). The course introduced us to
        the equations of stellar structure - four equations which construct a model that describes a star's properties - namely its internal structure, luminosity, temperature, radius and mass. Compounded with the optical depth equation, which defines the surface of the star, these make up a system of five coupled differential equations.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project aimed to solve these equations of stellar structure to generate simulated Main Sequence stars with various initial conditions using Range-Kutta methods.
